# Valuation

Valuation is the process of determining the intrinsic or fair value of an asset. It sits at the intersection of accounting, finance theory, and judgment. This module covers the three main families of valuation approaches used in practice and in research.

## A Framework for Thinking About Value

Any asset is worth the **present value of the cash flows it is expected to generate**, discounted at a rate that reflects the risk of those cash flows. This simple statement hides enormous complexity:

- **What cash flows?** Free cash flow to firm, equity, dividends?
- **What discount rate?** CAPM, APT, build-up method?
- **What growth rate?** Stable, two-stage, three-stage?
- **What terminal value?** Gordon Growth Model, exit multiple?

Multiples-based valuation sidesteps some of these questions by anchoring to market prices of comparable firms, but introduces different challenges around comparability and circular reasoning.
