# Time Series Analysis for Finance

This module covers the full spectrum of time series methods used in financial econometrics, from classical decomposition and exponential smoothing through ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, cointegration, and time-varying parameter models.

## Sessions

| # | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Time Series | Stationarity, autocorrelation, white noise, stylized facts |
| 2 | Decomposition and Smoothing | Trend-cycle-seasonal decomposition, moving averages, HP filter |
| 3 | Exponential Smoothing (ETS) | Simple, Holt, Holt-Winters, state space representation |
| 4 | ARIMA Fundamentals | AR, MA, ARMA, integration, Box-Jenkins methodology |
| 5 | Advanced ARIMA | Model selection, diagnostics, forecasting, SARIMA |
| 6 | GARCH Models | Volatility clustering, ARCH, GARCH, estimation |
| 7 | Advanced GARCH | Asymmetric models, GJR, EGARCH, forecasting volatility |
| 8 | Vector Autoregression (VAR) | Multivariate systems, Granger causality, impulse responses |
| 9 | Cointegration and VECM | Engle-Granger, Johansen test, error correction models |
| 10 | TVP-VAR Part I | Time-varying parameters, Kalman filter, state space models |
| 11 | TVP-VAR Part II | Estimation, stochastic volatility, connectedness measures |
| 12 | Integration and Applications | Combining methods, applied financial forecasting |

## How to use these notebooks

The course follows a natural progression from univariate to multivariate methods, and from constant to time-varying parameter models. Each session includes mathematical foundations, Python implementations, and empirical applications to financial data.
