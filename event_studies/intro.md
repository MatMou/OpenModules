# Event Studies in Finance

This module provides a comprehensive treatment of event study methodology, the workhorse empirical tool in financial economics. The course progresses from foundational concepts through advanced extensions, combining rigorous statistical theory with hands-on Python implementations.

## How to use these notebooks

Each session builds on the previous one. The markdown cells develop the econometric theory with full derivations, while the code cells implement each method step by step. Exercises at the end of each session provide practice opportunities.
