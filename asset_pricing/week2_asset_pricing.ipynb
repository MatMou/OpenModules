    "\n",
    "The **Lucas (1978) exchange economy** is the workhorse model of consumption-based asset pricing. It is deliberately stripped of production — there are no investment decisions, no firms that choose inputs. This allows us to isolate the pricing of risk in its purest form.\n",

    "### 1.1 The Physical Environment\n",

    "- The agent can trade shares in the tree. Let $z_t$ be the number of shares held from $t$ to $t+1$, and $P_t$ be the price of one share at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Budget Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "At each date $t$, the agent receives dividend income $z_{t-1} D_t$ and the value of their existing shares $z_{t-1} P_t$, then chooses how much to consume and how many new shares to hold:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_t + z_t P_t = z_{t-1}(D_t + P_t).\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- **Right side**: The discounted expected marginal benefit. Next period, the extra share pays $D_{t+1}$ in dividends and can be liquidated at price $P_{t+1}$, for a total payoff of $D_{t+1} + P_{t+1}$. Each unit of payoff is worth $u'(C_{t+1})$ in utility, discounted back at rate $\\beta$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The equity premium puzzle is not a failure of a particular parameterisation. It is a structural result: the covariance between consumption growth and equity returns is simply too small — by two orders of magnitude — to generate the observed equity premium at any reasonable level of risk aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this covariance so small? Because aggregate consumption growth is **smooth**. US per capita consumption growth has a standard deviation of only 3.6% per year. By contrast, stock returns have a standard deviation of roughly 17%. If consumption and stock returns were perfectly correlated, we would still need $\\gamma \\approx 17/3.6 \\times \\text{Sharpe ratio} \\approx 4.7 \\times 0.4 \\approx 19$ — still implausibly high. And in practice their correlation is only about 0.2, making the problem worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle is therefore: **why is aggregate consumption so insulated from stock market risk?** This question has driven three decades of research."

    "## 7. Habit Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "The equity premium puzzle arises because aggregate consumption is smooth. One response is to change the preferences in a way that makes the marginal utility of consumption *more volatile* even when consumption itself is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 External Habit (Catching Up With the Joneses)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abel (1990)** proposed that utility depends on consumption relative to a habit level $X_t$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u(C_t, X_t) = \\frac{(C_t/X_t)^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If habit is external (based on aggregate, not individual, past consumption), the SDF is still:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{t+1} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{C_{t+1}/X_{t+1}}{C_t/X_t}\\right)^{-\\gamma}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If $X_t = C_{t-1}$ (habit is last period's consumption), then $C_t/X_t = C_t/C_{t-1}$ — the SDF is driven by the ratio of growth rates, not the level. This can amplify volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 The Campbell-Cochrane (1999) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The most influential habit formation model is by **Campbell and Cochrane (1999)**. They use internal habit with a slowly varying surplus consumption ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preferences**: $u(C_t, X_t) = \\frac{(C_t - X_t)^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$, where $X_t$ is the habit level and the **surplus consumption ratio** is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_t \\equiv \\frac{C_t - X_t}{C_t} \\in (0, 1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "When $S_t$ is small, the agent is close to the subsistence level (habit), and marginal utility $u'(C_t - X_t) = (C_t - X_t)^{-\\gamma} = (S_t C_t)^{-\\gamma}$ is very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The SDF**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{t+1} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{C_{t+1} - X_{t+1}}{C_t - X_t}\\right)^{-\\gamma} = \\beta \\left(\\frac{S_{t+1} C_{t+1}}{S_t C_t}\\right)^{-\\gamma}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Even if consumption growth $C_{t+1}/C_t$ is smooth, if $S_{t+1}/S_t$ is volatile, the SDF is volatile — and risk premia can be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Campbell-Cochrane specification**: The log surplus consumption ratio $s_t = \\ln S_t$ follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{t+1} = (1-\\phi)\\bar{s} + \\phi s_t + \\lambda(s_t)(g_{t+1} - \\mu_g),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is the persistence, $\\bar{s}$ is the steady-state log surplus ratio, and $\\lambda(s_t)$ is a **sensitivity function** chosen so that the riskfree rate is constant:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda(s_t) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{S}} \\sqrt{1 - 2(s_t - \\bar{s})} - 1, \\quad \\bar{S} = \\sigma_g \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{1-\\phi}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**: Near the steady state, $\\lambda(\\bar{s}) \\approx 1/\\bar{S} - 1$. Since $\\bar{S}$ is small (habit is close to consumption), $\\lambda$ is large — a small consumption shock generates a large shock to the surplus ratio and hence to marginal utility. The effective risk aversion is $\\gamma/S_t$, which is much larger than $\\gamma$ alone when $S_t$ is small."

    "\n",
    "This week answered the question left open by Week 1: where does the SDF come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Lucas exchange economy** provides a complete general equilibrium framework. In equilibrium, the SDF is the representative agent's intertemporal marginal rate of substitution:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{t+1} = \\beta \\frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The Euler equation $u'(C_t) P_t = \\beta E_t[u'(C_{t+1})(P_{t+1} + D_{t+1})]$ is the equilibrium pricing condition. The endowment constraint $C_t = D_t$ closes the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CAPM** is a special case where the SDF is linear in the market return — a restriction that holds under mean-variance preferences or elliptical return distributions. The Security Market Line says the only priced risk is covariance with the market. The Fama-MacBeth procedure is the standard test, which the CAPM fails empirically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The equity premium puzzle** (Mehra-Prescott, 1985) establishes that with CRRA utility and calibrated US consumption data, the CCAPM requires $\\gamma \\approx 31$ to match the equity premium — an order of magnitude larger than plausible. Furthermore, any $\\gamma$ that matches the equity premium implies a riskfree rate far above 1% (the riskfree rate puzzle, Weil 1989). These are not failures of parameterisation — they are structural.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses to the puzzle**:\n",
    "- **Habit formation (Campbell-Cochrane, 1999)**: Makes the SDF volatile through time-varying effective risk aversion $\\gamma/S_t$. Requires only $\\gamma = 2$ in the curvature parameter, but generates extreme risk aversion during downturns.\n",
    "- **Epstein-Zin preferences**: Separates risk aversion $\\gamma$ from the IES $\\psi$. Fixes the riskfree rate puzzle without constraining $\\gamma$. Under i.i.d. consumption growth, does not resolve the equity premium puzzle — requires the long-run risks channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Week 3**, we will study two of the most influential quantitative models: the **long-run risks model** of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which combines Epstein-Zin preferences with persistent consumption growth, and the **disaster risk model** of Barro (2006) and Rietz (1988), which introduces rare, extreme consumption events.\n",

    "## Problem Set — Week 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1 — Lucas tree with log utility**: Consider a Lucas tree economy with $u(C) = \\ln C$, $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, and i.i.d. dividend growth $D_{t+1}/D_t = G$ deterministic. (a) Solve for the equilibrium price-dividend ratio $\\kappa$ analytically. (b) Show that the equity return is constant and equals $G/\\beta$. (c) How does the equilibrium change if $G > 1/\\beta$? Interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2 — The Euler equation under CRRA**: Suppose $u(C) = C^{1-\\gamma}/(1-\\gamma)$ and log dividend growth $g_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_g, \\sigma_g^2)$ i.i.d. (a) Derive the exact formula for $E[M_{t+1}]$, $E[R_m]$, and $\\text{Cov}(M_{t+1}, R_{m,t+1})$. (b) Verify that $E[M_{t+1}] \\cdot E[R_{m,t+1}] + \\text{Cov}(M, R_m) = 1$. (c) Show that the equity premium in logs equals $\\gamma \\sigma_g^2$ when consumption equals dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3 — The CAPM beta**: A portfolio $p$ has expected return 9%, beta 1.2, and idiosyncratic volatility 20%. The riskfree rate is 2% and the market risk premium is 5%. (a) What is the CAPM alpha of this portfolio? (b) If you build an equally weighted portfolio of 100 such assets (each with idiosyncratic vol 20% and the same beta), what is the variance of the resulting portfolio? What happens as $N \\to \\infty$? (c) Explain in words why idiosyncratic risk is not priced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 4 — Equity premium puzzle calibration**: Using the formulas derived in this notebook, (a) find the value of $\\gamma$ (with $\\beta = 0.99$) that simultaneously minimises the sum of squared deviations of the model's equity premium and riskfree rate from the US data targets. (b) Compare this to the individual solutions. (c) At the solution $\\gamma$, compute the implied HJ distance and the implied coefficient of variation of $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 5 — Habit formation and time-varying risk aversion**: In the Campbell-Cochrane model, the effective risk aversion is $\\gamma_{\\text{eff}} = \\gamma / S_t$. (a) If consumption falls by 5% below the habit level, what is the surplus ratio $S_t$ and the effective risk aversion (use the calibration from the notebook)? (b) How does this compare to a recession scenario where consumption falls 1% below its mean? (c) Explain why time-varying risk aversion generates countercyclical risk premia — an empirically realistic feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 6 — Epstein-Zin SDF**: Suppose $\\gamma = 10$, $\\psi = 1.5$, $\\beta = 0.99$, and consumption growth is i.i.d. lognormal with $\\mu_g = 0.018$ and $\\sigma_g = 0.036$. Assume the wealth portfolio return equals the equity return. (a) Write out the Epstein-Zin SDF explicitly. (b) Compute $\\theta = (1-\\gamma)/(1-1/\\psi)$. (c) Compute the log riskfree rate using the EZ formula and compare to the CRRA formula with $\\gamma = 10$. (d) Under what conditions does EZ utility reduce to CRRA?\n",
