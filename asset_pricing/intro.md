# Asset Pricing

This module develops the theoretical foundations of asset pricing in a block-by-block progression. We start from first principles — how agents make decisions under uncertainty — and build up to the modern consumption-based framework and its extensions.

## Course Structure

### Block 1 — Decision Theory Foundations

| Block | Topic | Key Concepts |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1.1 | Preferences and Utility | VNM axioms, expected utility, Bernoulli utility |
| 1.2 | Risk Aversion | Arrow-Pratt coefficients, CARA, CRRA, certainty equivalents |
| 1.3 | Intertemporal Choice | Time preference, discount factor, consumption Euler equation |

### Block 2 — Equilibrium Asset Pricing

| Block | Topic | Key Concepts |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2.1 | The SDF Framework | Stochastic discount factor, pricing kernel, no-arbitrage |
| 2.2 | Mean-Variance and CAPM | Frontier mathematics, beta pricing, Sharpe ratios |
| 2.3 | Factor Models and APT | Multi-factor models, APT, Fama-French, empirical tests |

### Block 3 — Puzzles and Modern Extensions

| Block | Topic | Key Concepts |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3.1 | The Equity Premium Puzzle | Mehra-Prescott, Hansen-Jagannathan bounds, calibration |
| 3.2 | Habit Formation | Campbell-Cochrane, external habits, time-varying risk aversion |
| 3.3 | Recursive Preferences | Epstein-Zin, separation of risk aversion and EIS |
| 3.4 | Long-Run Risk | Bansal-Yaron, persistent consumption growth, volatility dynamics |

## How to use this course

The blocks are designed to be read sequentially within each section. Block 1 builds the microeconomic foundations, Block 2 derives the core pricing models, and Block 3 confronts these models with data and develops modern solutions. Each block contains full mathematical derivations, economic intuition, and connections to the broader literature.
