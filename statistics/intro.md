# Statistics for Finance

This module develops the statistical foundations required for rigorous empirical work in finance. While the tools are general, every concept is framed around financial applications — from testing the normality of returns to diagnosing regression models used in factor analysis.

## Philosophy

Statistics in finance is not just about computation — it's about **understanding what the numbers mean and where they can mislead**. We pay particular attention to:

- The assumptions behind each test and what happens when they're violated
- The difference between statistical significance and economic significance
- Common pitfalls: data snooping, look-ahead bias, overfitting
