# Volatility Modeling

This module provides a comprehensive treatment of volatility modeling in financial markets, progressing from classical univariate specifications through realized measures, stochastic and rough volatility models, and multivariate extensions.

## Sessions

## How to use these notebooks

The course is designed sequentially. Early sessions build the classical GARCH toolkit, middle sessions introduce non-parametric and continuous-time approaches, and the final sessions cover multivariate and applied topics. Each notebook combines mathematical derivations with Python implementations.
